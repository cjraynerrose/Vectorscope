# Vectorscope
Fiddle proj.

Watched a video about songs that draw images on vectorscopes and wanted one.

Current plan is to have the program read in a .WAV file and render the images for each sample pair to a list.

This list can then be scrubbed thru.

Many plans to go further but this will give minimum functionality to begin with.
